<p>Statsbaba was launched in december, 2014 with a dream to provide every possible guides and tutorials related to Statistics.
The main goal of starting this blog is to build an active community of statisticians so that they and we can learn every aspect of 
statistics in a better way.</p><br>

<p>Hello Guys, this is me –" Statsbaba". I had a classmate in my Bachelors and people used to call him "baba"(I don't know why :P) and he was studying stats at that time . So, I used to call him "Statsbaba". This is how title for this blog came.Statsbaba aims at projecting the use of statistics via Storytelling. We believe in the power of storytelling. We create events, characters (which are most of the times real) and tell stories about statistics so that people can retain the information for more time in their minds. We're always eager to learn new things in statistics and fields related to statistics like datascience. We have not been able to spent pretty good hours with writing more for our readers but we try our best. 
<br>
Also, we like to think about making this initiative popular so that we could attract more people towards statistics and fields related to statistics. This thought encourages me to do more better in future as what I did in my past days.
</p>
<p>What’s my future plan with this blog?
I want  statsbaba to be a platform to learn good and real statistics. I want to make a blog that helps every visitor at every stage to deal with the issue and problems they face in their statistical career or other . So, I hereby invite all people if they could deliver a good post, keynotes ( a short video lecture). Please feel free to contribute.

We love what we do and hope to build our and your's career in Statistics with your continuous love, support and care. :)
